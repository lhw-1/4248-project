# 4248-project

## Overview 

This project was done as part of CS4248: Natural Language Processing, a course in National University of Singapore (NUS).

Our project aims to analyze the shortcomings and performance of baseline models for the extended Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset, [e-SNLI](https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/e-SNLI), as well as Facebook's [InferSent](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent), and subsequently propose and implement some areas of improvements based on the findings. The project relates to textual entailment and focuses on two main tasks: (1) generation of explanations from given pairs of premise and hypothesis, and (2) prediction of a label based on the premise, hypothesis, and the generated explanation.

## Navigating this Repository

The main scripts are located in the `e-SNLI` and `InferSent` directories, each containing Python scripts and notebooks on analysis for e-SNLI and InferSent respectively.

The `plots` directory contains various diagrams created from our analysis, and the `pred_outputs` directory contains the predicted outputs generated by the baseline models when run on the test (and sometimes validation) dataset.
