# 4248-project

## Project Overview 

This project was done as part of CS4248: Natural Language Processing, a course in National University of Singapore (NUS)

Our project aims to analyze the shortcomings and performance of baseline models for the extended Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset ([e-SNLI](https://github.com/OanaMariaCamburu/e-SNLI)), and subsequently propose and implement some areas of improvements based on the findings. The project relates to textual entailment and focuses on two main tasks: (1) generation of explanations from given pairs of premise and hypothesis, and (2) prediction of a label based on the premise, hypothesis, and the generated explanation.
