This EDA (exploratory data analaysis) directory contains 2 directories.

1. pre-run: EDA conducted on all data (train + dev + test) before running of any models (i.e. no predictions have been made yet).

2. post-run: EDA conducted on data generated after running of specific models against dev and/or test input data (i.e. after predictions have been made yet)
